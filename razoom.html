    <span class="concept">The Goal:</span>
    <span class="tagline">raise a million dollars for charities. On a single day. Every day.</span>
    <div class="details">
      We know it can be done - we've done it many times - but it wasn't easy.
      And now we will make it easy, for any committed individual,
      to make a game of raising money for good causes.
      <br>
      A team of 35 people could do it - if each one raised $30,000.
      They just have to reach out - to 300 friends - who donate $100 each.

    <span class="concept">The Team:</span>
    <span class="tagline">A group of Committed Individuals</span>
    <div class="details">"Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back-- Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now." - Goethe</div>
