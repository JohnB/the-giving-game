    <span class="concept">The Goal:</span>
    <span class="tagline">raise a million dollars for charities. On a single day. Every day.</span>
    <div class="details">
      We know it can be done - we've done it many times - but it wasn't easy.
      And now we will make it easy, for any committed individual,
      to make a game of raising money for good causes.
      A team of 35 people can do it - just commit and reach out -
      to 300 friends - who donate $100 each - raising $30,000 -
      which totals to a cool million.

    <span class="concept">The Team:</span>
    <span class="tagline">A group of Committed Individuals</span>
    <div class="details">There is a famous quote from <em><a href="http://wikipedia.com/goethe">Goethe</a></em> that starts
      <blockquote>"Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back..."</blockquote>
      and ends with the thought that
      <blockquote>"... the moment one definitely commits oneself,
      then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that
      would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from
      the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents
      and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed
      would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it.
      Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now."</blockquote></div>

      To raise a freakishly large amount of money, you need to be freakishly
      committed to raising it or it won't happen. It is on your mind, and
      on the tip of your tongue, at every opportunity. You tell your friends,
      your co-workers, your neighbors and random strangers that you are
      raising money for this good cause.

    <span class="tagline">Hint: they are your fellow donors!</span>
    <div class="details">
      Inviting someone to donate is an invitation to join in raising money.
      Anyone can do it. You have friends and your friends have freiends and
      soon enough you have a team competing to raise a million dollars.
